        <h2>What is the project?</h2>
        <p>
            This is a web app to help people publicise and find local in-person gaming events. This app was made with React, Node, and DynamoDB.
            People could post about events, where they are happening, what games are to be played, and what people need to bring. 
            People could then sign up for these events, as well as send friend requests to other accounts.
