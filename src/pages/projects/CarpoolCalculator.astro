        <h2>What is this project?</h2>
        <p>
            This is a web app that calculates the most efficient route to have everyone carpool to a single destination. 
            It takes in information like where everyone is meeting, where people are starting from, and what cars are available.

        <h2>What did I accomplish?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Created autocomplete field for selecting a location</li>
            <li>Created a component to create appendable lists of forms to get information from user</li>
            <li>Created pages for gathering information on the destination, starting locations of groups, cars, and the routes</li>
            <li>Wrote API calls to openroute Service for geocoding and routing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Are there any notable compromises that were made?</h2>
        <p>
            I made the decision to use openroute service because I wanted to take as minimal of a risk of running into API costs as possible, 
            seeing that this is a free webapp with no advertising space used. There are limitations to the locations available as a result: 
            many addresses are unavailable. There are some workarounds for this - streets and venues tend to be more reliable - 
            but it is still a notable drawback to to project.
